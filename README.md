Coding Dojo Java Assignment

FizzBuzz
Write a program that will take an integer and print Fizz if the number is divisible by 3, Buzz if the number is divisible by 5, FizzBuzz if the number is divisible by 3 and 5, and the number itself for all other cases.

Objectives:
● Practice conditionals.

● Implement a classic interview algorithm.

Tasks:
● Create a FizzBuzz class that implements the following logic:

public class FizzBuzz {
    public String fizzBuzz(int number) {
        // fizzbuzz logic here
    }
}

Output for 3:

Fizz
Output for 5:

Buzz
Output for 15:

FizzBuzz
Output for 2:

2
● Create a FizzBuzzTest class that you will use to check the outputs of the fizzBuzz() method.
